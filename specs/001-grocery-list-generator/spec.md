# Feature Specification: AI-Powered Grocery List Generator

**Feature Branch**: `001-grocery-list-generator`
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "build an application that can help me generate a grocery list of items to purchase based on user input. The user input could be "I want to make pasta" and the grocery list to include necessary items in the list. The agent is powered by Gemini to do reasoning and ask question to user to further refine the input such as what type of pasta, sauces, vegetration or meat so on. Another example "I want to add toilet paper and some cleaning agents", the AI Agent should also suggest a few items to be added. The user will be presented a list to add in a check box. Once user confirm the list of item with a checkbox, the list will be generated. There can be multiple groceries list which the user can retrieve from the webapp."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Generate a grocery list from a recipe name (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want to be able to type in the name of a recipe (e.g., "pasta"), so that the application can generate a list of ingredients for me to buy.

**Why this priority**: This is a core feature of the application.

**Independent Test**: A user can enter a recipe name and see a generated list of ingredients.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is on the grocery list creation page, **When** they enter "pasta" into the input field and submit, **Then** the system should display a list of ingredients for making pasta.

### User Story 2 - Generate a grocery list from a general description (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want to be able to type in a general description of what I need (e.g., "toilet paper and some cleaning agents"), so that the application can suggest a list of items for me to buy.

**Why this priority**: This provides an alternative and flexible way for users to create grocery lists.

**Independent Test**: A user can enter a general description and see a list of suggested items.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user is on the grocery list creation page, **When** they enter "toilet paper and some cleaning agents" and submit, **Then** the system should display a list of suggested items including toilet paper and various cleaning agents.

### User Story 3 - Refine the generated grocery list (Priority: P3)

As a user, I want the application to ask me clarifying questions to refine the grocery list (e.g., "what type of pasta?"), so that the generated list is more accurate.

**Why this priority**: This improves the accuracy and usefulness of the generated lists.

**Independent Test**: When a user enters an ambiguous query, the system asks for clarification.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has entered "pasta", **When** the system determines the query is ambiguous, **Then** it should ask the user for more details, such as "What kind of pasta?".

### User Story 4 - Confirm and save the grocery list (Priority: P4)

As a user, I want to be able to review the generated list of items, select the ones I want with a checkbox, and then save the list for later.

**Why this priority**: This allows users to finalize and persist their grocery lists.

**Independent Test**: A user can select items from a generated list and save them as a new list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has a generated list of items, **When** they select several items using checkboxes and click "Save", **Then** a new grocery list should be created with the selected items.

### User Story 5 - Retrieve saved grocery lists (Priority: P5)

As a user, I want to be able to view my saved grocery lists, so that I can access them later.

**Why this priority**: This allows users to access their previously created lists.

**Independent Test**: A user can view a list of their saved grocery lists.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a user has saved grocery lists, **When** they navigate to the "My Lists" page, **Then** they should see a list of their saved grocery lists.

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the user enters an irrelevant query?
- How does the system handle misspelled words in the user input?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST provide a text input field for users to enter their grocery list request.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST use a large language model (Gemini) to understand the user's input and generate a list of grocery items.
- **FR-003**: The system MUST be able to handle both recipe-based and general description-based requests.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST ask clarifying questions to the user to refine the grocery list.
- **FR-005**: The system MUST display the generated grocery list to the user with checkboxes for each item.
