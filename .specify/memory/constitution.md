## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality
All code submitted to the project MUST be well-documented, adhere to the established style guide (see STYLE.md), and be written with long-term maintainability in mind. Code should be clear, concise, and self-explanatory wherever possible.

### II. Testing Standards
All new features and bug fixes MUST be accompanied by comprehensive unit and integration tests. A minimum of 80% test coverage is required for all new code, and pull requests that lower the overall coverage will not be accepted.

### III. User Experience Consistency
The user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) MUST be consistent across the entire application. All new UI components and workflows must adhere to the project's design system and established UX patterns.

### IV. Performance Requirements
The application MUST meet the defined performance benchmarks outlined in PERFORMANCE.md. All new code must be written with performance as a primary consideration, and any changes that negatively impact performance must be justified and approved.

## Development Workflow

All code changes MUST be submitted as a pull request and undergo a thorough code review process by at least one other team member. The pull request must include a clear description of the changes, and all automated checks (linting, testing, etc.) must pass before it can be merged.

## Governance

This constitution is the single source of truth for project development standards. Amendments to this constitution can be proposed via a pull request and MUST be approved by a majority of the project maintainers.
